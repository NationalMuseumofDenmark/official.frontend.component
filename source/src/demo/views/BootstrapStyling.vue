            <h2>Boostrap styling</h2>
            <p>
                Some Bootstrap components should be used as-is, since we have not wrapped or
                extended their functionality. They will appear differently by simply being
                inside a <code>n-section</code> / <code>.n-style</code> classed container.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this page we present those different appearances.
